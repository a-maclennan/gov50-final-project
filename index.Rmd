## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the 2022 midterm elections and Asian American voters, or other data related to Asian Americans and American politics. I could potentially study Asian American voting behavior over time related to some other factor such as specific ethnicity, what generation immigrant they are, etc. Or I could look at what issues they rate as being most important to them, or whether thay're more likely to vote for Asian candidates regardless of party affiliation.
